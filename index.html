                    <p class="text-faded">The Association of Black Social Workers Child Adoption Counseling and Referral Services (aka ABSW Adoption Services) is a not-for-profit adoption agency that is authorized/licensed by the New York State Office of Children and Family Services.  The Service began in 1975 and has over been serving the community for over 40 years.  It is a program affiliated with the New York Chapter Association of Black Social Workers but has its own separate incorporation. <br><br><br> The Agency works with couples and single persons who wish to adopt children that are free for adoption who are in the foster care system and families who wish to engage in domestic private adoptions.  We also do intercountry adoptions for families who wish to adopt minor relatives.  We are not a foster care agency but work with agencies throughout New York City and surrounding counties as well as nationwide who do foster care.  The Service works with Hague Accredited agencies to do intercountry relative adoptions.</p>
